# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project! 💖 All types of
contributions are encouraged and valued. If you haven't done so already, please
take a couple of minutes to read through the [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Issues

If you'd like to ask a question, report a bug, suggest a feature, or provide
any other kind of feedback, feel free to open an issue in this repository.
While filing issue(s), please keep the following guidelines in mind:

- Always provide as much context and/or relevant information as you can.
- For **bug reports**, include detailed instructions that someone else can
  follow to reproduce the bug or error.
- For **feature requests**, try and be clear about why existing features and
  alternatives do not work for you.
- Before creating a new issue, look through the [existing ones](/issues?q=is%3Aissue)
  to make sure you aren't duplicating any of them.

## Pull Requests

Want to contribute some code and/or documentation to this project? That's
awesome! Feel free to fork this repo and open a PR with any changes you'd like
to propose. And don't worry about your potential contributions being "too
small", even if you're just fixing a typo or rewording a sentence to be more
clear. Any improvements are welcome and very much appreciated - so **thank you**
in advance!

If you're new to GitHub or have never filed a PR before, you might
find these resources helpful:
- [This tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects)
  will teach you the basics of how to contribute to a repository by forking it
  and creating a pull request.
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is a beginner-friendly app that
  can simplify your interactions with both Git and GitHub.
  - If you're unfamiliar with Git and/or using command-line tools, then you
    probably want to pick this option when you reach the part of the tutorial
    that presents a choice between "the command line, GitHub CLI, or GitHub
    Desktop".
- [This guide](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop#forking-a-repository)
  includes detailed instructions and visuals to help you through the rest of
  the process with GitHub Desktop.

### After you open a PR

The [pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci/) tool will run some checks to ensure
your changes are consistent with the [config](/.pre-commit-config.yaml) for this repo.
- Some failing checks may be automatically fixed by the tool, and the resulting
  changes will be added to your PR as a subsequent commit.
- Some things may require manual fixing. You can make the requested changes in
  your local copy of the repo, then commit and push to your PR branch again.
  This will update the PR and trigger a re-run of all the checks.

Once your PR passes all of the pre-commit checks, a project maintainer will
review it.
- If the maintainer asks for any changes: make the necessary edits, commit and
  push to your PR branch, and then ask for another review. This back-and-forth
  may happen more than once, especially if your changes are non-trivial.
- If the maintainer decides to pass on your PR, they will thank you for the
  contribution and explain why they won't be accepting those particular changes.
  That's okay! We still really appreciate you devoting your time to help improve
  this project, and hope to see other contributions from you in the future. 💗
- If your PR gets accepted, it will be merged into the repository's `main`
  branch. This means your contribution has officially become part of this
  project and will be distributed to our users soon!
